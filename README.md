# Home_Automation
The main aim of the project is to control the home applications voice using Android OS smart
phones with a Node MCU. This is an advanced technology in the home automation, so houses are
getting smarter. Usually conventional wall switches are located in different parts of the house and often
require persons for their operations and, thus, manual pressing turn the on and off. It becomes very
difficult for the elderly or physically handicapped people to operate them. 

This system is enhanced to control the home applications through an Android application of smart/ tablet phones by entering the
selected number for corresponding load. The electrical loads are controlled by the relay which
is connected to the Node MCU, the relay performs the switching operation. Then the respective device
connected to the circuit will be turned on or off depending on the commands given by the user.

The main objective of taking this project was to automate ordinary home appliances using this
project which will result in the appliances only used when it is required by the user, ultimately saving
the power consumption and thus reducing energy wastage and increasing the life of the appliance.

This project can be integrated with the common appliances of the household like lights, fans
and many more other appliances to give the user the full automated control using an app on the
smartphone.

The major aim of this project is to provide a platform which has never existed before. The
application software will work along with the google voice recognition services(Google Assistant),
where it will get the voice command and it will be converted into text format so that it could be
understandable in a logical way and that command will be transferred to NodeMCU via Wi-Fi, and at
that point the command will be executed to complete the task, ultimately the action will be performed
in the way device is pre-programmed.

If we put the things in more short and logical form, following are some of the major aims of our
project.

- This project is designed to use the voice recognition technology to control home utilities i.e.
light and fan
- Its implementation especially focuses on the needs of disabled people.
- Android phone will be used for the application software which will be connected to the google
voice command input.
- Application software will be responsible for converting the voice command into the text
format.
- Ultimately application software will transfer that command to IFTTT where we have created
applet.
- Webhook will make web request to cloud server of blynk where code is present
- Blynk server will change status pins where devices like light, fan are interfaced.
- Commands which we have included are lights on/off, fan speed 1,speed2, speed3,speed4
- Major home utilities for our project are light, fan. Each of them follows the certain command
that is programmed.
- The aim is to use this IoT technology for the people of all ages, gender and even with some
disability to enjoy the life in a more pleasant way.
